        <h3>Description</h3>

<p>
netlog is a Loadable Kernel Module that logs information for every connection on the hosted machine.
By utilizing the kprobes API, it probes the connect and accept system calls ,for TCP connections,
as well as the bind system call, for UDP connections, and the socket destruction. 
While probing, it logs the process name and process id, the user id that owns this process, the protocol
(TCP/UDP), the local IP address and port as well as the remote IP address and port.
</p>

<p>
For UDP, it tracks only the bind system call, because UDP is a connectionless protocol,
so the other approach was to track the packet communication, something that would
add a lot of overhead. In order to compile the code that tracks UDP, you 
have to change the symbolic constant (PROBE_UDP) that it's defined in the netlog header (netlog.h) from
zero (0) to a non-zero value (i.e. 1) and recompile netlog.
</p>

<p>
netlog also tracks the destruction of the sockets. This is done by probing the 
inet_shutdown kernel call, which is called after the close system call is called.
In order to compile the code that tracks the connection close, you need to change the value of the
symbolic constant (PROBE_CONNECTION_CLOSE) that is defined in the netlog header file (netlog.h) from 
zero (0) to a non-zero value (i.e. 1) and recompile netlog.
</p>

<h3>Dynamic whitelisting</h3>

<p>
netlog offers whitelisting of connections at insertion time. This is done by passing parameters to the module.
The parameter is named connections_to_whitelist and it's an array of strings with the following format:

<pre><code>"/absolute/execution/path|i<ip address>|p<port number>"</code></pre>

i.e.:

<pre><code>
"/usr/bin/sshd|i<127.128.0.0>|p<22>"
"/usr/bin/sshd|i<127.128.0.0>"
"/usr/bin/sshd|p<22>"
"/usr/bin/sshd"
</pre></code>

<p>
The '&lt' and '&gt' can be ignored, they are supported just for visual reasons.
</p>
Example of whitelisting multiple connections:
</p>

<pre><code>
modprobe netlog connections_to_whitelist="/usr/sbin/skype","/usr/bin/ssh|i<127.0.0.1>","/usr/bin/sshd|i<127.0.0.1>|p<22>"
</code></pre>

<p>
Note that you are not able to whitelist an ip address or port without specifing an absolute 
execution path of a binary. Also, you can whitelist up to 150 connections. For more, change
the symbolic constant MAX_WHITELIST_SIZE in whitelist.h and recompile netlog.
</p>
<p>
Do not leave spaces between the comma separator and the strings because the parameter array will not be initialized.
</p>

<h3>Absolute Path Mode</h3>

<p>
The absolute path mode is activated by passing a non zero value to the debug_mode parameter.
i.e.:

<pre><code>modprobe netlog.ko absolute_path_mode=1</pre></code>

<p>
Absolute path mode will log the absolute execution path instead of the process name.
This will be helpfull in case that you want to see the absolute execution path of a connection that
you want to whitelist.
</p>

<h3>Before reading the source code</h3>

<p>
First of all you have to be experienced with the C language and by experienced I mean at least to
be familiar with pointers. Also you need to know how the system calls are handled from the Linux Kernel
and to be familiar with the inet level of the kernel source code. For the last thing, grep is your friend.
Furthermore you have to know how kprobes works (or at least its API).
