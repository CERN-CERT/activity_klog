						|Description|
						+-----------+

Netlog is a Loadable Kernel Module that logs information for every connection.
With the help of kprobes API, it tracks the connect and accept system calls and 
in case that the connection for TCP, it logs the process name and Process ID, 
the User ID that owns this process, the protocol (TCP), the local IP address and port as well
as the remote IP address and port.

For UDP, it tracks the bind system call, because UDP is a connectionless protocol,
so the other approach was to track the packet communication, something that would
add a lot of overhead. The data that is logged, is the process name and Process ID,
the User ID of the process owner, the protocol (UDP) and the information about the IP address
and port that bind holds at its parameters. In order to compile the code that tracks UDP, you 
have to change the symbolic constant (PROBE_UDP) that it's defined in the netlog header (netlog.h) from
zero (0) to a non-zero value (i.e. 1).

Netlog also tracks the destruction of the sockets. This is done by probing the 
inet_shutdown kernel call, which is called after the close system call is called.
If the socket is created for a TCP protocol or a UDP (if UDP probing is true) it
logs the process name and Process ID that created it, as well as the Used ID that owns this
process, the protocol (TCP or UDP), the local IP address and port and the remote IP address and port.
in order to compile the code that tracks the connection close, you need to change the value of the
symbolic constant (PROBE_CONNECTION_CLOSE) that is defined in the netlog header file (netlog.h) from 
zero (0) to a non-zero value (i.e. 1).

Whitelisting:

netlog offers whitelisting of executables. Change the symbolic constant WHITELISTING in netlog.h header
to 0 or 1, if you want to compile or not the whitelisting code accordingly. Then, add the full execution
path of the executables that you are interested in wtelisting at the netlog.h header.

TCP connect:
Dec 19 14:03:17 panos-PC kernel: [ 1341.648413] netlog: http[3206] TCP 137.138.191.167:52507 -> 130.59.10.36:80 (uid=0)

TCP accept:
Dec 19 14:18:37 panos-PC kernel: [ 2262.125936] netlog: sshd[827] TCP 137.138.191.167:22 <- 137.138.32.18:49904 (uid=0)

UDP binds:
Dec 19 14:22:50 panos-PC kernel: [ 2515.081074] netlog: skype[4261] UDP bind 127.0.0.1:0 (uid=1000)
Dec 19 14:22:50 panos-PC kernel: [ 2515.271375] netlog: skype[4261] UDP bind (any IP address):2752 (uid=1000)

Connection close:
Dec 19 14:19:07 panos-PC kernel: [ 2292.580879] netlog: sshd[3755] TCP 137.138.191.167:22 <-> 137.138.32.18:49904 (uid=0)

						+--------------+
						|How to compile|
						+--------------+

In the source directory run:

	make -C /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build M=$PWD

Then run:

	insmod netlog.ko

in order to insert the module in the kernel.
And in order to remove it, run:

	rmmod netlog

					+------------------------------+
					|Before reading the source code|
					+------------------------------+

First of all you have to be experienced with the C language and by experienced I mean at least to
be familiar with pointers. Also you need to know how the system calls are handled from the Linux Kernel
and to be familiar with the inet level of the kernel source code. For the last thing, grep is your friend.
Furthermore you have to know how kprobes works (or at least its API).

With the current approach of tracking the connection close, if the process doesn't call the 
close system call, the tracking cannot be done. So I have to find the kernel call (if any)
that is called even if the close system call is not called, in order to destroy the socket.
